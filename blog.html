<h2> Protect Women From Domestic Violence </h2>
<h6>Published on August 2, 2015,by Priyanka in Women Empowerment Issues.</h6>
In today’s contemporary world women have all the rights to be able to get same powers as men do have i.e. there should be gender equality. Thanks to the technology that has bought a big change in empowering women by declining the discrimination that is being happening with the women from distant past. But even today, a few women are still facing several obstacles in the way to brightening their life, due to the gender discrimination of the culture that is being followed now and then very often. This sort of behaviour is most commonly seen in developing countries and India is no where exception to it.
<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, the women in India are now wishing to get a life where they would get equal rights and opportunities as men get in this society. This is possible if the country, India help women in getting empowerment in various sectors. A few of these sectors include – education, service, medicine, engineering, politics and everywhere. Women should receive value from their colleagues, relatives and even from their households. However, they have right to fight for their equality if they have been abused physically or emotionally by any of their family members or somebody from the society. But, in most places that are not fully developed, under development and rural areas, there are women who are literally being abused. No matter, how the people living there have customs or religious beliefs against the women, it is a time to realise the fact that women is no where less than men.
<br>
<br>
Today, women who have been owned and organized their venture, who are in the politics and women who are in the superlative and excellent positions are live examples to prove their strength. Fighting for women right is every human right. With the increase in the number of social crimes, women’s suffrage there is a greater demand for country to provided strong protection of women from domestic violence. Although, the word “domestic violence” is heard very rare in developed countries, this should be a sign For India that shows how imperative it is to provide social rights without gender inequality.
<br>
<br>
This upsetting issue i.e. the negative sexual attention faced by Indian women is an embarrassing situation that they often receive. This is what making the country notorious and bring called as a place that is probably unsafe for women. There are several social abusing activities that these women facing, a few of them are bullying, harassing, discrimination, gender difference and female foeticide or infanticide (where baby girls have been killed ignorantly). So, all this clearly states that India needs to avoid obsolete laws and words, and need to present and implement schemes that work for the welfare of the women. Several programs by government or voluntary services need to be encourage that fight for the protection of women from domestic violence, letting women to have capability to raise their voice, participate, equally share rights in the society and expressing their views, no matter they like or dislike it. Therefore women should be given all the rights they are worth to; after all they are the most imperative in every field.


<h2> Save The Tiger and The Girl Too </h2>
<h6>Published on July 16, 2015,	by Aviral in Women Empowerment Issues.</h6>
Women have contributed hugely for the growth of many economies in the world. Therefore it is important to safeguard the interest of women so that they can be able to realize their potential in the social-economic and religious outputs for the utmost growth and development of any economy. But in some economies the roles of women and the girl child have been neglected as women are viewed as inferior to men.
<br>
<br>
First of all we must save the girl child by advocating for gender balance and equal opportunities for both boys and girls. For this, women education in India is absolutely necessary. For example in the Far East countries like India, the over adoration of boys over girls has led to some women to conduct fetal scans to determine the gender of the unborn babies and some have resulted to abortions if the unborn is a girl. This dangerous trend has resulted to more boys being born in some states and leading to a situation where the girl child population is decreasing significantly as compared to that of boys.

To save the girl child we have to acknowledge that a child is a gift from the creator whether a boy or a girl and hence need to be given the same chances of survival. Although there are many organizations from the government or the private sector who are advocating for the girl child rights, the overall responsibility narrows to everyone to accept that the girl child is equally important as the boy child.
<br>
<br>
We need to realize that to save the girl child from the many tribulations they face from society is not a special request but a mandatory directive that should be adhered to. The society needs to develop policies that give equal rights to all regardless of gender and enact laws that govern the right of women and the girl child which should be adhered to by everyone irrespective of culture, social status, ethnicity or religious beliefs.

Research from organizations that advocate for the rights of girls show that in actual reality what a boy can do a girl child can do better. In order to save the girl child we need to deviate from traditional beliefs that women and young girls are meant for the kitchen and to care for their male counterparts and embrace the spirit of equality in all aspects.
<br>
<br>
Let us save the girl child by giving them all the support they need for a better world to live in because without the girl child there is no women and without women there is no human survival since no one knows how to love and care better than women.

<h2> Equal Access Education Between Men and Women </h2>
<h6>Published on July 13, 2015,	by Prerna in Women Empowerment Issues.</h6>
India, the second most populous country in the whole world, has a total population of 1,220,800,359 million people, of which 587.236.392 million are females between 0 years and 65 years and over, according to a July 2013 estimate provided by the CIA World Factbook.

Even though it is not a poor country anymore – the 4th most developed economy in the world, with a GDP of $4.761 trillion in 2012, education is still a long term challenge in India, especially for young girls and women. A 2009 Indian government report shows that the drop-out school rate was of 25% and includes girls and also poor and disabled children.
<br>
<br>
Although women’s education is as important as men’s education, girls are being banned from school by their families because of the attacks and the sexual assaults the girls are victims of. Being afraid that these attacks will affect a girl’s honor, the family prefers to drop her out of school.
<br>
<br>
Official numbers reveal the level of women’s education in India. School life expectancy for Indian girls, from primary to tertiary education, is of 10 years, while for boys is of 11 years. Studies also show that unemployment rate for young females between ages 15-24 is of 11.5%, while for young boys between same ages is of 9.8%.

The literacy rate for Indian people between ages 15 and over is of 61%. By sex, 73% of the Indian men can read and write, while 47% of the women are able to do these basic things. Nevertheless, a 2006 estimate brings out into open that mother’s mean age at first birth is 19.9 years, whereas a 2013 estimate unveils that every woman has 2.55 children.

Why is so hard for an Indian girl and or woman to go to school and complete her education? The answer is somewhere between a dozen of reasons: because most of the people in India think that women are chattels or property and because the government says girls should be educated but does too little in order to support them.
<br>
<br>
Another reason is that women in India are not united and very few stand up for what they believe in. Last but not least, because the fathers of these girls don’t care enough for their children so they rise up. In conclusion, because of the patriarchal mindsets that rules India.
<br>
<br>
Sita Anantha Raman, an Indian Professor Emeritus at Santa Clara University, in San Francisco, California, believes that the difference between men and women in India is even deeper. She maintains that Indian women who completed their education and work side by side with men receive less income for the same job. On the other hand, she is confident in the women power movement in India and in the NGO’s that support and demand greater and sustained support for equal access education between men and women.

<h2> An Educated Girl, An Educated Future </h2>
<h6>Published on July 12, 2015,	by Tarun in Women Empowerment Issues.</h6>
Emmaline Pankhurst once said that freeing a woman is freeing a half of the human race because they represent a half of the population. On the other hand Nellie McClung advised the society never to underestimate the power of a woman. Education a woman can be likened to educating the whole family because of the role they play in families.
<br>
<br>
Women education in India plays a key role in the social and economic development of the country. Educating a woman uplifts her life as well as the quality of her life and her entire family. It is a fact that any educated woman will definitely support the education of her children especially a girl child and provide a better guidance to her children. An educated woman will easily imbibe an independent and progressive outlook in her children. More importantly, an educated woman in a society like India will assist in reducing the infant mortality rate and control the blossoming of the population. Education for women plays an important role in women empowerment.

Because of the negative perception of women in India, this article examines reasons behind the neglecting of women education, importance of women education, importance of women education in India and what the Indian government is doing to reverse the situation.

<h2> A Girl Needs No Special Rights, Only Equal </h2>
<h6>Published on July 7, 2015,	by Saakshi in Women Empowerment Issues.</h6>
Gender discrimination is one problem that continues to affect women in India. The traditional oppressive norms have relegated women to secondary status at the workplace and in the household. This has left them with little or no education at all, poor health and financial status, as well as little involvement in the political arena. They are quickly married off when too young, and that means they become mothers at a tender age. They cannot cope with the stringent domestic and financial responsibilities.

No doubt, gender equality in India is something to question. It’s shocking that women are always treated last in the society, last to receive medical attention and last to serve food for themselves. So it’s a common scenario to see malnourished women in India. Statistically, only 54% of women in India are literate, compared to 76% of men. That shows that women receive little schooling, and an unfair inheritance as well as divorce laws. Because of all these factors, it’s impossible for them to accumulate a substantial financial asset which means no security for them.
<br>
<br>
In Rajasthan, gender equality issues have been aggravated by seasonal immigration. Rural Rajasthan doesn’t offer sufficient economy to sustain a family all year round. So women are left behind with the burden of taking care of the entire household. Now, statistics estimate that a woman’s income is 30% lower compared to that of a man working in the same condition in India. This is because while they work, they must also attend to domestic chores back at home. This way of life in Rajasthan undermines women’s rights for gender equality in India.

Most Indian communities have what we call a ”son preference”, and this is something that is widespread throughout the country. Cultural beliefs have made people to submit to the notion that having sons is one way of guaranteed financial security. Therefore, it’s clear that these culture work to devalue the role of women in these societies. They strive to achieve equality with men, making gender equality in India an issue.
<br>
<br>
In an effort to restore sanity to women, several NGOs have moved in to campaign on their behalf. They have built small networks among women geared towards giving them economic stability. They also come up with ideas such as micro-finance to give women an opportunity to occupy leadership positions. Other NGOs in the area come with an aim to help women explore their talents and skills which could see them generate income. What these NGOs are doing is to organize change at a local level and also plan participatory action to eliminate stereotypes and generate awareness of what a woman can do.
